# C++ Calculate Pi
## Calculate Pi to around 13 decimal places accurately

This code is used to calculate, by hand, the Pi constant accurately to around 13 decimal places.
The original goal was to calculate to 15 places accurately, and beyond, by hand.
Since the number of rounds of calculations to get to a high degree of precision would have been in the tens/hundreds of
millions, I opted to stop at 1 million rounds.

Since this was just a pet experiment, I would not personally recommend that the constant generated by the
code be used in any sort of production environment or for any sort of serious real world calculations.

To run the code, simply run the source file through a compiler that supports the C++ 14 standard.
Code was compiled on Windows, using the MSVC++ compiler (optimizing compiler).

It may take a few seconds to generate the result, and write the result to a file, depending on your machine's hardware.
Even with a C++ optimizing compiler, generating Pi to around 13 decimal places accurately will take a bit of time!

Example: `g++ -std=c++14 example.cpp -o example` and then `./example`.
